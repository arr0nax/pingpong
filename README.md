#Ping Pong
#Clayton Collins


##Takes a number and returns it with multiples of 3,5, and 15 changed in to fun surprises


##Behaviours
###1. populate an array with numbers approaching the users input
#### input: 3
#### output: [1,2,3]

###2. check and replace all multiples of 15
#### input: 15
#### output: ping-pong

###3. check and replace all multiples of 5
##### input: 5
##### output: pong

###4. check and replace all multiples of 3
##### input: 3
##### output: ping

###5. take new numbers replace the old ones
##### input: 15 (after 12 has been entered)
##### output: a new list that goes to 15 instead

###6. Fun stuff!

##Setup
###Setup is pretty simple. Users can enter a number, then press the button or hit return to create a list of numbers that follows the rules above. There is also a minigame where they can hit any key to ping pong back and forth in the banner.

##Bugs
###*Images don't remove themselves after they have been created. I couldn't think of an efficient way to do that, so I think of them more as a high score.
